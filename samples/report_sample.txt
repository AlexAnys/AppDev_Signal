Problem Statement

Our sales pipeline has grown increasingly complex, leading to
longer cycle times and lower conversion rates.  The objective of
this report is to identify bottlenecks in the process and propose
concrete steps to streamline the pipeline.

Methodology

We collected quantitative data from our CRM over the past
18 months and conducted interviews with key sales personnel.  The
analysis focused on lead response times, stage durations and
common points of failure.

Conclusion

The investigation revealed that delays in responding to inbound
leads account for nearly 40 percent of lost opportunities.
Automating the initial outreach and enforcing stricter SLAs could
significantly improve conversion rates.  Additionally, we
recommend consolidating duplicate stages in the pipeline to
simplify the user experience.
