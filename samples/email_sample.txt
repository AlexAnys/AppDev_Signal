Hi team,

Thanks for joining yesterday's planning session.  We agreed to
finalise the project timeline by Friday and to circulate draft
specifications by next Wednesday.  Jane will coordinate with the
design team; please provide her with any outstanding assets.

Action: compile the first draft of the timeline (due Thursday).
Todo: review the scope document and add any missing sections.

Regards,
Alex
